## List of TODO's
1. ~~Figure out how to encrypt api key~~
2. ~~Create the json_normalize function that goes through every single nest header and list through every level of our jsons so we can convert to Dataframe~~
3. Once that's done, create a loop for the matchv5 api call to by 100 game increments and store it in dataframes but in a way that's saved locally and transferably (very important!), I only want to have to make that call once for old data
4. Create a function that gets all matches not already retrieved (to update our list of games)
5. Create a README
